# CS160_CQ3_JaredVazzana
Time Complexity: Mini-Max Sum: Big O(n^2)
The reason why the big is n squared is because there are 2 for loops, 
that means we have to check and compare all elemetns at least n^2 times in oreder 
to account for all combinations the sum could be

Time Complexity: Hackerrankinastring!: Big O(n)
The reason why the big O is n is because we need to itterature through hte string once.
While itterating we need to find if the string "hackerrank" is in it. 
This process does not reauire taking any additional checks which would increase the time complexity
